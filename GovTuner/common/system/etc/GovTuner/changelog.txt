- Major efficiency update on hybrid algorithm
- On-boot-execution improved
- Replaced main_detect with much efficient detection methods and functions to accurately assign values to the CPUs
- Code size reduced by 30%, increased efficiency
- Target_loads and above_hispeed_delay are checked and have been bound within frequency bandwidth of the SoC
- Added conditional check in the end of hybrid script for looping
- Interval_chooser modified : No more options , user can input thier choice for loop interval
- Values revised for all devices and profiles
- Increased optimization and overall efficiency
